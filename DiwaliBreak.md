Apparently we need to know OOPs for learning java hence I got back to the language I know best - Python. 
So I learnt about classes, objects, attributes (properties of objects) and methods. Apna college 1st lecture along with 1 basic program
UPDATE: I also learnt about Static methods, Abstraction and Encapsulation (Can't enter note because they are on register)
