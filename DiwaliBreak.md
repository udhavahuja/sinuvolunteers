Apparently we need to know OOPs for learning java hence I got back to the language I know best - Python. 
So I learnt about classes, objects, attributes (properties of objects) and methods. Apna college 1st lecture along with 1 basic program
UPDATE: I also learnt about Static methods, Abstraction and Encapsulation (Can't enter note because they are on register)

I am back with OOPs (Not completed yet) and learnt about some basick (that was a wordplay) like del PRIVATE attributes & methods and most importantly inheritance.
Thats it, it was a hectic day so could only give 20 min but it is festive season(LOL)


**Udhav Ahuja (23-10-2025)**
Ok I see a pattern in dates anyways I finally completed OOPs (Don't say that I took more time than needed festive season is indeed busy). So today I got on Hands with class method, decorators, Polymorphism and Operator Overloading. Also got to know about dunder fuction
